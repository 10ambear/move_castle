## What?
This is my version of the [Move Castle](https://learn.movecastle.info/courses/move-on-sui) Learn Move on SUI course by ChainIDE, but I commented on every line of code to explain what it does. I did not change any code from the original as I'd like this to be a referance (similar to an audit).

## Why?
To test if I truly understand every line of code (not just what it says, but what it means).

## Corrections
If you you spot any mistakes, please let me know. You can create a PR or message me on X [@10ambear](https://twitter.com/10ambear). If you have different opinions about what the code does I'd love to hear them!
